  	An <b><em>Internship</em></b> Provides Real
  	Life Experience and
  	Exposure. Employers in
  	today's labor market rely
  	heavily on resumes that
  	illustrate a relevant work
  	history, whether that's from
  	internships, volunteer work,
  	or actual job experience. A
  	practical work background
  	carries a major significance
  	when attempting to enter the
  	job market. It's all about
  	competition.

    	The experiences we go
    	through are what shapes us.
    	Your internship will not only
    	<b><em>encourage personal
    	development</em></b>, but also a
    	greater understanding of self.
    	To know yourself is to know
    	your goals and how to best
    	achieve them. Finding this
    	level of clarity is difficult, but
    	sometimes all it takes is
    	trying someone new, out of
    	your comfort zone.

    	<b><em>Networking</em></b> is an exchange
    	of information between
    	people, with the ultimate goal
    	of establishing
    	acquaintances and
    	relationships to advance your
    	professional career. Sure,
    	you can attend a networking
    	event without doing an
    	internship, but you would be
    	limiting yourself. Partaking
    	in an internship allows you to
    	establish deeper
    	relationships than you
    	normally would talking to a
    	stranger one-on-one.

        <b>-Sameer</b></pre>

    <pre style="font-family: calibri;margin-left: 76%;margin-top: -29%">
    	The student is given a
    	chance to decide whether
    	they wish to continue with
    	their current career path or
    	try something else. The more
    	experience you acquire, the
    	better you position yourself
    	for success in landing a job.
    	An internship is the building
    	blocks necessary for creating
    	the path to a <b><em>successful
    	career</em></b>. So next time you're
    	on a gap year or summer
    	break, you might want to
    	consider indulging in a
    	meaningful internship and
    	build towards your future.
